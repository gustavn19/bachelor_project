Repository for bachelor project: Investigating the suitability of performance metrics for medical generative image models

The repository includes the following files:

- chexpert_model.py --> Used to train InceptionV3 model on new data
- data_processing.ipynb --> Used to do general data processing both prior to modelling and evaluation.
- eval_model.py --> Used to evaluate InceptionV3 model
- fid_experiment.py --> Structure for performing experiment 1 and 2 of the project
- fid_experiment_ny.py --> Structure for performing experiment 3
- nih_image_load.ipynb --> Usde to process NIH data

The datafiles and weights are not uploaded. The datafiles can be found through the links in the report, and the NIH-InceptionV3 weights will be uploaded to a google drive as soon as possible.
